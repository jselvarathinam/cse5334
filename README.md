# cse5334

This is my completed assignment 1 for Dr. Park's CSE 5334 class. The objective of this assignment was to build and train an image classifier that could classify whether an image is a picture of a schooner, airplane, or motorbike. In order to train and test the classifier we built we were given a dataset hosted on Kaggle consisting of 798 images of motorbikes, 800 images of airplanes, and 63 images of schooners (1661 images total). The code is contained in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook can be run simply by opening it in Colab and running all its cells.
