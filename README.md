Assignment 1

This is my completed assignment 1 for Dr. Park's CSE 5334 class. The objective of this assignment was to build and train an image classifier that could classify whether an image is a picture of a schooner, airplane, or motorbike. In order to train and test the classifier we built we were given a dataset hosted on Kaggle consisting of 798 images of motorbikes, 800 images of airplanes, and 63 images of schooners (1661 images total). The code is contained in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook can be run simply by opening it in Colab and running all its cells.

Assignment 2

This is my completed assignment 2 for Dr. Park's CSE 5334 class. The objective of this assignment was to design, build and train a Naive Bayes text classifier that could identify whether a given sentence from a job posting was one of the following 6 classes: Responsibility, Requirement, Skill, SoftSkill, Experience, or Education. The dataset I used came from Kaggle and was called the "Ford Sentence Classification Dataset". It consisted of around 60,000 sentences taken from job postings. The code for this assignment is contained in a Google Colab notebook. The notebook can be run simply by opening it in Colab and running all its cells.
